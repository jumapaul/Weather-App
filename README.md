## Craft Silicon Limited Interview Solution

ðŸ‘€  Solution code for the weather app for crossplatform using [flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
The final app looks like this:

#### Screens
| Location permission                      | Current location date               | Searched location date                 |                        |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| ![Location permission](images/three.png) | ![Current location](images/one.png) | ![Search location dat](images/two.png) |                        |

### Prerequisites

- Before running this app, you need to have java 19 installed:

- Ensure the minimum sdk set above 21 and multiDexEnabled set to true on app/build.gradle:

```shell script
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
```
- Ensure the compile sdk is set to 34:
```shell script
    android {
    compileSdk = 34
```
- On the lib/app folder, add a package constants and a class constants and add the `apikey` and the `googleApiKey` as a static const.
- Once the project is set up, run:
```shell script
    flutter pub get
```

### Background
Develop a mobile application using Flutter (Dart)/Native Android (Java/Kotlin) / Native  iOS (Swift) that fetches and displays weather data from the OpenWeather API. The app should showcase good UI/UX design and handle data fetching and offline storage
effectively.
#### Core features
##### 1. App Overview:
The app should display the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a selected
city.
- Users should be able to search for a city and view its weather details.
- The app should show a loading indicator while fetching data from the API.

##### 2. UI/UX:
The app should have a clean, modern, and user-friendly design.
- Use appropriate icons, typography, and color schemes to enhance the user experience.
- Ensure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

##### 3. API Integration:
Fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- Use appropriate API endpoints to get current weather and forecast data.

##### 4. Offline Support:
Implement offline storage to save the weather data locally.
- Display cached weather data when the app is offline.
- Indicate to the user when the data was last updated.

##### 5. Error Handling:
- Handle possible errors such as network issues or API errors gracefully.
- Display user-friendly error messages.
